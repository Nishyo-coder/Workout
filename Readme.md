# Fitness Tracker
Developed the backend of a workout tracker created with a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema to handle routes with Express.

# User Story
Users are able to view create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise,  the usre is Iable to track distance traveled.

## Installation

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
